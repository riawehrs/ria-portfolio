          <p class="section-paragraph">I spent the summer of 2014 working as a design intern at a startup accelerator. Rex is the project that I spent a majority of my time on there. One of the lead designers established a basic style guide that I worked within to create the UI for things like the vet practice page, scheduling feature, login and sign up modals, user account pages, and clinic account dashboard.</p>

          <h3 class="section-heading">WTA Web Presence</h3>
          <p class="section-paragraph">In early October of 2015, I noticed that the dealership owned by relatives of mine could use some help with their advertising. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been spending my free time helping them out with their marketing strategy, visual design, and website. I kept their preexisting logo, as it was already printed on an array of physical items, and then expanded from there to create a visual style to use on their website and in their ads.</p>
          <p class="section-paragraph">I&rsquo;ve started designing a new website for them, which you can see some WIP mockups for above, and am continuing to improve upon it to ensure that it suits their needs. Most dealership websites are extremely cluttered because they are designed by services that sell one-size-fits-all templates. I intend for this site to be a breath of fresh air, as it is designed to prioritize the needs of prospective customers instead of distracting them with a bunch of ambiguous CTAs. The last thing I&rsquo;ll do is design a landing page that helps convey the things that are unique about WTA and give people a clear idea of what it&rsquo;s like to work with them.</p>
          <p class="section-paragraph">Though the visual design for the site isn&rsquo;t yet complete, I&rsquo;ve started developing some of the pieces with the assistance of my sister, who is learning front-end development. We are using Craft CMS, as it seems like an ideal solution and is something I&rsquo;ve been wanting to learn about anyway. One of the primary challenges for me will be writing a Craft plugin that automatically imports vehicle inventory data from a CSV file, maps it to the fields of a Vehicle entry, and then creates an entry for each vehicle so that the vehicle details can be edited via the Craft control panel if needed.</p>
