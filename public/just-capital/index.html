          <h3 class="section-heading">Corporate Issues That Actually Matter</h3>
          <p class="section-paragraph">Through their initial research, Just Capital discovered 10 key corporate issues that American people care about the most. I helped create an interactive portal that allowed users to explore the issues, which were divided into 4 groups: Work, regarding how businesses treat their employees; Impact, regarding how businesses influence society and the environment; Buy, regarding how businesses create relationships with their customers; and Invest, regarding how businesses address governance and profitability.</p>
          <p class="section-paragraph">I owned and wrote most of the CSS for this project, and used jQuery for things like triggering various navigation bar states and selectively loading the background video in non-mobile browsers. I spent a few weeks working onsite in SoHo, Manhattan, with a designer, a backend dev, and the small digital agency that hired each of us.</p>
          <p class="section-paragraph">The development timeline ended up being rather rushed, as the agency and client were still finalizing content sections into the final week before launch. As such, the designer could only mock up a general desktop layout for the issue pages, with wireframe-style boxes in place of some content areas. I rolled with it and created styles as needed to suit various types of content, then made the portal responsive.</p>
          <p class="section-paragraph">Overall, this was a very fast-moving project, and I learned a lot while working on it. It helped me develop a new level of confidence in my ability to produce high quality work at an efficient pace. In the future&ndash;when beneficial and appropriate&ndash;I&rsquo;ll be clear from the start about the importance of distinct project milestones and explain how certain content-related deliverables impact the progress of design and development tasks.</p>
