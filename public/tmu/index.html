          <h3 class="section-heading">ThreadMeUp Admin Panel</h3>
          <p class="section-paragraph">I started working with a local startup called ThreadMeUp, or TMU, in January of 2014. At the time they were in the process of developing their platform and were hoping to launch a beta version rather quickly. My initial job was to improve their admin panel, which was a portal used internally to handle various business-related tasks.</p>
          <p class="section-paragraph">The admin panel was in a rough, almost unstyled state, since the launch of the main platform was the top priority. My goal was to make it feel more organized, easier to use, and visually cohesive with their newly designed customer-facing app. I started by incorporating the global styles and UI kit that the team&rsquo;s design lead had created for the main site. After that, it was a matter of laying out content in a way that felt nice and made sense.</p>

          <p class="section-paragraph">I sometimes sketched pages before coding them, but ended up making most of the layout and style related decisions during development. The product designer gave me feedback whenever they had time, and I learned a lot of new things about design in addition to development. Overall, the TMU admin panel was an ideal first project for me and got me off to a great start towards becoming a design-oriented developer.</p>

          <h3 class="section-heading">On CSS Frameworks</h3>
          <p class="section-paragraph">TMU&rsquo;s product designer had redesigned their platform the previous spring, and they needed help implementing it properly and extending it as needed. I joined the project team as a Designer&ndash;Developer hybrid, and my first task was to build the new UI kit on top of Bootstrap.</p>
          <p class="section-paragraph">I believed that it would be ideal to build the UI kit without trying to incorporate Bootstrap, but I didn&rsquo;t push it too much when others disagreed. We were on a tight timeline, and even though using Bootstrap was inefficient for me, I could tell that debating about whether or not we should use Bootstrap was going to be even more inefficient.</p>
          <p class="section-paragraph">I&rsquo;m not averse to using CSS frameworks in situations where it makes sense to do so, and whenever one is already being used in a project I do my best to fully utilize it. But with certain types of projects, it can take more time, effort, and code to override and extend framework styles than it would take to write well-organized styles on top of a more unopinionated base (even when making use of the option to override a framework&rsquo;s default variables).</p>
          <p class="section-paragraph">Overall, I use frameworks when needed, but enjoy exploring various approaches to writing modular CSS from the ground up.</p>

          <h3 class="section-heading">Designer on the Dev Team</h3>
          <p class="section-paragraph">The product designer assisted with front-end development for the first month, but in early October I was left as the only design-oriented member of the team. Due to time- and resource-related constraints, we needed to scale back our plans for the new platform. Balancing my perspective as a designer with my perspective as a developer, I discerned which aspects of the redesign were vital enough to fight for and which ones were unrealistic for the time being.</p>
          <p class="section-paragraph">I was the only CSS-focused dev on the project, so another dev would often set up the basic functionality for a UI component before I styled it. But being a CSS dev didn&rsquo;t just involve styling some components and being done with them. The components had various states and combinations of states, and I collaborated with the JS dev to make sure the right states were triggered in the right situations. It was an iterative process, and we went back and forth on some sections a few times until they were solid.</p>
          <p class="section-paragraph">One design-related aspect of my role involved testing the interface and noting any potential usability issues. Most of these observations involved insufficient feedback from the interface in response to a user action. I helped identify and address cases in which the user might feel unsure of what was happening or of what they should do next.</p>
          <p class="section-paragraph">Another aspect of my dual role was to help adjust some features to meet new requirements that arose late in the development process. I ensured that we implemented changes that suited the new specs from a functionality standpoint without making the interface complicated or confusing to use.</p>
          <p class="section-paragraph">In hindsight, now that I have experience working on bigger projects with a formalized QA/UAT process, I can describe one of my main roles as that of identifying and fixing issues that would normally fly under the radar until being caught during QA/UA testing.</p>

          <h3 class="section-heading">TMU Movements Landing Page</h3>
          <p class="section-paragraph">In December, I developed a new responsive landing page for TMU&rsquo;s newly relaunched Movements site. I started by coding a layout for desktop, based off of the design mockup, then used my best judgment to adapt and adjust it for smaller screens and mobile devices. It was an interesting and challenging project, especially in regard to ensuring that the scroll effects functioned well and looked aesthetically pleasing at various resolutions.</p>

          <h3 class="section-heading">Design-Oriented Development</h3>
          <p class="section-paragraph">Though it feels natural now to be engaged and vocal during the product development process, I was much more passive when I first started working as a developer. To me, being design-oriented was about aesthetic precision and obsessing over visual details. Now, I see it as the ability to adapt to constraints while properly balancing the priorities of visual accuracy, user-friendliness, performance, and customer requirements.</p> 
          <p class="section-paragraph">I credit my experience working on the TMU Movements project as a turning point regarding how I define my role as a design-oriented developer. Since there were no other design-focused team members to delegate tasks to me, I had to pay attention to the big picture, identify and prioritize issues, and be proactive in executing solutions.</p> 
          <p class="section-paragraph">In the end, I learned that the things that seem important when I&rsquo;m zoomed in aren&rsquo;t always the same things that seem important when I&rsquo;m zoomed out, and that it&rsquo;s important to view all issues in the context of a project&rsquo;s unique goals, constraints, and requirements.</p>
