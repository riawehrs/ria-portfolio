            <p class="project__intro-desc">Toggle TV is an android based app that enables users to stream movies to their TV. In March of 2014, I coded a web-based 1080p prototype to serve as an interactive demo of the app design.</p>

          <h3 class="section-heading">Interactive Prototype</h3>
          <p class="section-paragraph">The Toggle prototype was to be used in upcoming meetings with prospective investors. As such, there was a fairly tight timeline and budget within which the interactive demo piece needed to be produced. We knew it would always be presented on a TV display, so it suited their purposes to have it be a fixed size.</p>
          <p class="section-paragraph">One of the primary optional things I wanted to do but didn&rsquo;t have time for was to implement infinite looping functionality for the slider. Seeing as this was one of my first front-end jobs, my skills have grown a lot since I worked on it. I&rsquo;d love to go back to it sometime and make the slides loop seamlessly.</p>

          <p class="section-paragraph">In August 2014, I developed a new landing page for Toggle. The project had to be responsive this time, of course, but overall it was much more straightforward than the interactive prototype.</p>
